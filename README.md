This CSS is intended to be used with a corresponding HTML structure. The main purpose is to style the structure. For example, the css styles elements like the header, navigation, sections and footer.

Example basic HTML Structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <nav>
            </nav>
    </header>
